The **Container** widget is a versatile widget that allows you to create a box model for your UI. It can contain multiple child widgets and provides options for customization, such as padding, margin, decoration, width, height, and more.
While Container can be used for centering a single child, it is not limited to that. It provides more extensive control over the layout and appearance of its child widgets.

The **Center** widget is primarily used for positioning a single child widget at the center of its parent. It takes one child and centers it both vertically and horizontally within its available space. If you want to center a single child widget in a container or a screen, you can use Center.

In Flutter, a **StatefulWidget** is a widget that can change dynamically over time. Unlike **StatelessWidget**, which is immutable once created, a StatefulWidget can hold mutable state. When the state of a StatefulWidget changes, the widget can rebuild its user interface to reflect the updated state.
